# Description
The Last Panda is a 2 players Game created during the [Global Game Jam Montreal](http://globalgamejam.org/). 
We had 48 hours to create a Game.



# Game play
Panda's babies are lost on the wild and dady must bring them back home! (Otherwise, who will eat the bamboo!...). 
As soon as dady panda has all its baby, players win.
However, if panda fall down or gets hit by a terrible wave, shame on the players and you lose.

## Players
### Panda player
**Controls dady Panda**.
It has simple behaviors like moving (Left,right), jumping and climbing ladders. 
Unfortunately, some places are unreachable and panda needs help from the second player.

### VR player
**Help panda player**.
He is 'inside' the game. He must help the Panda player by moving platforms so that panda can reach other places. 
The map is divided into 3 rings, the one where panda currently is can't be moved.
Important communication skills are required to inform panda about events, platform disposition...
(For example, to warn if he can jump down)

## Waves
Things are easy so far, but dady panda has some company! 
Several waves randomly pop at the bottom map. 
Their hight is random thought they might never reach the upper ring.
Panda player can't see them from far, but VR player should warn him of the danger.



# Animations

### Panda Idle animation
When Panda is not moving, he's breathing, and here the animation. 
(I actually hope he's always breathing, but well, you can see it only with Idle animation.)

# Behind the Unity
We had some challenge creating a 2D space for a 3D Virtual Reality environment.
We end up using this "ring" representation where VR player is actually in the 
middle whereas Panda player has a 'fake' 2D platformer view.
